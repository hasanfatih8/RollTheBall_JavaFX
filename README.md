# RollTheBall_JavaFX
**Prerequests:**  
* JavaFX library
* Putting the tile photos and .txt files in the same project folder with Test.java and Tile.java
## What's the game?  
The game's purpose is moving the ball from a start point to the end end point with pipes. We need to create a proper path to move the ball. It's kinda sliding puzzle. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0igRpVMSVQ)  

#### Rules  

* Player can move tiles horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
* Player can't move static pipes, start point, end points.
* Player can move non static and brown tiles only to the empty places.
* Player can play only 5 levels for now :smile:
